# CrowdGuru

We created a web application that allows the crowd to provide recommendations for any question a user might have. We first describe our webapp and how to use it/access its different components. Then we explain what we would like you--the user--to do to contribute and who to contact if you run into issues with the webapp not working or if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

You can visit the webapp here: 
Once you follow the link, you should find yourself on a Login page with the option to Sign Up.

# Access and Use

### Login Page

If you do not have an account yet, simply enter a username and password into the Sign Up fields and click the "Sign Up!" button. The next time you use the webapp, you will be able to login using the Login section. After you sign up, you will be taken to your Profile page. 

If you do already have an account, simply enter your username and password into the Login fields. You will be taken to your Profile page.

### Profile Page

On your Profile page you will see two sections, splitting the page into left and right sides. The left side contains your profile information (relatively bare for this deliverable but which will include your name, birthdate, etc.). The left side also contains a button that will bring you to the Question page where you can ask a question. The right side contains a list of unresolved questions, sorted in decreasing order of upvotes, so the most upvoted / least downvoted questions are at the top and the least upvoted / most downvoted questions are at the bottom. This is where you can browse questions that other users have asked. Clicking on one of the question links will bring you to the Recommendation page where you can vote on the quality of the questions and its existing recommendations or provide a recommendation of your own.

### Question Page

The Question page allows you to ask a question and seek recommendations from the crowd. You will see three default fields. The first one is the Category. You should complete this field with a general term or phrase describing the category of your question (i.e. Movies, Music, Fashion, Food, Books, etc.). The second field is the Question. This is where you will type out your full question (i.e. What movie should I watch tonight?). The third field is the Interests field. This is where you can specify your interests (i.e. The Notebook) so that the crowd can provide you with more accurate recommendations. Each Interests field should represent one interest. If you'd like to specify more interests, simply click the "Add another interest" button and another Interests field will appear. When you have completed each of these fields, click the "Ask!" button and your question will be submitted and made available to other users so that they can provide recommendations for you.

### Recommendation Page

The Recommendation page shows a single question and the chain of existing recommendations that have been made for that particular question. You will be provided with the option to upvote or downvote the question or any of the recommendations. You will also be provided with the option to mark any existing recommendations as spam. On this page you will have the ability to provide a recommendation for the user who asked the question by using the text box that says "Recommend something!" After you have typed out your recommendation, simply click the "Make recommendation!" button and your recommendation will be added to the existing list of recommendations for that question. If you feel that one of the existing recommendations is the same as or very similar to what you would recommend, then you can simply upvote that recommendation rather than writing a redundant recommendation of your own.
